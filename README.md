# Inkwell's Inksanity

Inkwell's Insanity is a roguelike word-based adventure game, drawing inspiration from the classic Bookworm Adventures.
Players take on the role of a pencil-wielding knight, battling through waves of monstrous enemies using their wits and vocabulary.
Each encounter presents a board of letter tiles, where players must form words to launch attacks, with longer or more complex words unleashing more powerful strikes. 
The game combines strategic word-building with the unpredictable nature of roguelike elements, making each playthrough unique as players explore dungeons, defeat enemies, 
and upgrade their knight's abilities through a rich narrative world crafted in Unreal Engine.
